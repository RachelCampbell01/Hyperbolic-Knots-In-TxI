<h1>Finding Knots In TxI</h1>

<p>Knots embedded in the space TxI correspond to links consisting of the Hopf link plus one other component. The program SnapPy can be used to find these links by testing each link in the Thistlethwaite link table, which is a census of links up to 14 crossings. The pages linked below give various lists of knots in TxI found.</p>
